# OG 8.x-1.0
https://www.drupal.org/project/og

Forked OG to start converting submodules to 8.x

So far we have the OG overarching module and the OG_UI module converted to work with 8.x. 

Many functions are still not working as intended.

This is a work in progress. It has more bugs than the movie Starship Troopers. And a whole lot less Rico.
